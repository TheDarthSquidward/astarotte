# AstarotteBot

Forked from my original account (georgyorgy1). I got locked out because my email provider suspended my account for not logging in for 6 months (Hint: it's not Gmail, Yahoo or ProtonMail).

Dependences:
1. Python 3.5.3 and above
1. psutil
2. Discord.py 
&nbsp;

Installation:
1. Install the dependencies
2. Edit config_example.json and save it as config.json
3. Create SQLite DB (see schema.sql)
4. Start by typing "python3 astarotte.py" in a terminal or in cmd.exe

&nbsp;
Existing bugs:
- Bot does not use the prefix stated in config.json
